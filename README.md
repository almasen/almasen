### Hey there! :elephant:

I am a software engineer at King's College London particularly passionate about security, authentication and cryptography.

Since college I have begun open sourcing my personal projects and now that I have a few public repos with which I am mildly satisfied, I have been pleased to see that they are also of interest to others some with over 2k downloads on npm.

Please see below for a sample of what I'm working on.

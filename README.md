### Hey there! :elephant:

I am a Computer Science student at King's College London and currently the lead developer of [RDFmapped](https://github.com/almasen/rdf-mapped).

Following some shy periods when I would not want to share a project before it's finished - and well, if there is one thing I have learned, it is that technically a project is never finished -, I have recently begun open sourcing my personal projects.

Now that I have a few public repos with which I am mildly satisfied, I finally mustered the courage to begin working on long-planned ideas as well as issues at popular public repositories. I also love cool infographics and stats so here are some:
